# PyNXReader
 Python Lib for reading information from Pokemon Sword and Shield and LGPE

 This library is more focused on reading information for hunting/overlays/just knowing the info as opposed to botting.

 This is a fork of PyNXBot by [wwwwwwzx](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx) so credit to them and other who worked on the original project!

## Warning
 I won't be liable if your Switch get damaged or banned. Use at your own risk.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
	* Install z3-solver, pyserial, pyusb, pillow, pokebase, numpy, and discord via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) if `ImportError` happens.
	   `pip install z3-solver` 
	   `pip install pyserial`
	   `pip install pyusb`
	   `pip install pillow`
	   `pip install pokebase`
	   `pip install numpy`
	   `pip install discord`
* CFW
* Internet Connection
* [sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase)
* [joycon-sys-botbase](https://github.com/Manu098vm/sys-botbase) For LGPE (you can only use one sys-botbase at a time)
* [ldn_mitm](https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm)

## Usage
* The scripts to run are contained in the ./tests/ folder
* Use [CaptureSight](https://github.com/zaksabeast/CaptureSight/)/CheckDen script to check your Den id for the Den scripts
* Scripts labeled "Check'name'.py" will display info on that type of encounter in the console
* "GUIReader.py" Is the script you need to run if you want GUI reading of Wild/Legendary/Fusion Pokémon for SWSH or Battle/Trade/Gift/Legendary/Active Pokémon for LGPE.
* "GUIOverworld.py" Is the script you need to run if you want GUI reading of Overworld Pokémon
* The other scripts are for dumping info and can be mostly ignored for the average person

### Usage: Overworld Scanner Discord Bot
Prerequisite of a discord bot account and a discord server.

In order to run the bot do the following:
1. Copy *config.template.json* to *config.json*
2. Fill out *config.json* with appropriate values.
3. Execute *tests/OverworldDiscordBot.py*
4. From the discord server, run the *$download_emoji* command, download the marks zip, and add them to your server.
5. After the marks are added, you can run the *$start* command to start the bots scanner thread.
* $start is used to start the scanner thread
* $stop is used to close the scanner thread
* $restart is used to close then re open the scanner thread
* $shutdown is used to close the scanner thread and the discord bot

### Usage: PLA MMO Filter
* aggro - This will cause the program to run in aggro pathing only mode. Set to false to do non aggro pathing.
* alphafilter - If set to true, it will filter out any result that is not an alpha pokemon.
* shinyfilter - If set to true, this will filter out any non shiny results. If used with alphafilter, this will only display shiny alpha pokemon.
* blacklist - Put species name in quotes, separated by commas (example: ["Gastly","Haunter","Machop"]) and these species will not be checked. Bonus rounds will be ignored too. Use at own peril.
* whitelist - Fill in the same as blacklist. This will display all shiny results even if alphafilter is set to true.
* rolls - put in your number of shiny rolls.
